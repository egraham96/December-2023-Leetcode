//Let n be the length of list A and m be the length of list B

// Time Complexity: O(n). Although the time complexity appears to be quadratic due to the while
// loop nested within the for loop, closer inspection reveals it to be
// linear. Because the while loop is reached only when currentNum marks
// the beginning of a sequence (i.e. currentNum-1 is not present in
// nums), the while loop can only run for n iterations throughout the
// entire runtime of the algorithm. This means that despite looking like
// O(nâ‹…n) complexity, the nested loops actually run in O(n+n)=O(n)
// time. All other computations occur in constant time, so the overall
// runtime is linear.

//Space Complexity :In order to set up O(1) containment lookups, we allocate linear space
//for a hash table to store the O(n) numbers in nums. Other than that,
//the space complexity is identical to that of the brute force solution.
